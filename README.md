# Welcome to my Portfolio - Minh Ha Pham

## Why this website exists

This website is a passion project that spanned the better part of 2 years, and an experimentation ground for me to explore some of my new interests in web development.

I have decided to find out some of the more interesting parts of front-end development that **rarely sees the light of production**, and overhaul the UI completely!

I hope you enjoy browsing through my website!

## Technologies

This website was made with **NextJS, MaterialUI, Three.js, GSAP, and anime.js.**

- [MUI](https://mui.com/)

## That's it!

This website is still very much a work in progress, so I hope you enjoyed it! I will be continuously updating the site with new stuff I find interesting, and keep you updated with all of my side projects!
